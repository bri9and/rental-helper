# REMINDER: Restocking Service Idea

**Date:** January 14, 2026
**Status:** DISCUSS WITH SEB ON RETURN

## The Idea
Advanced packages include hands-off restocking - we ship supplies directly from Amazon to properties when inventory runs low. No carrying inventory, pure dropship model.

## Seb's Notes
- For advanced/premium subscription tiers
- Ship from Amazon (no inventory holding)
- Seb has additional ideas to share

## Claude's Research & Ideas

(Being populated by background research...)

## Growth & Expansion Ideas

*Brainstormed January 14, 2026 - thinking beyond the initial Amazon dropship model*

### 1. Beyond Consumables - The Full Property Lifecycle

**Linens & Textiles Program**
- Partner with commercial linen suppliers (like Standard Textile or 1888 Mills) for hospitality-grade sheets, towels, and bedding
- Offer "linen refresh subscriptions" - automatic replacement every 6-12 months based on property turnover rates
- Track linen condition through guest feedback and cleaning staff reports
- Opportunity: Hosts currently replace linens reactively; proactive replacement prevents bad reviews

**Small Appliances & Electronics**
- Coffee makers, toasters, and hair dryers have predictable lifespans (2-3 years in rental properties)
- Track usage patterns from our inventory data to predict when replacements are needed
- Pre-stage replacements so they arrive before failure
- "Never have a broken coffee maker again" - compelling pitch

**Furniture-as-a-Service**
- Partner with furniture rental companies (CORT, Fernish) or create our own program
- Track furniture condition, coordinate replacements during low-occupancy periods
- Bundle with our existing data: we already know the property, might as well manage all assets
- This is a bigger capital play but differentiating

**The Vision:** Become the "property maintenance brain" - not just consumables, but everything that needs replacing on a schedule.

---

### 2. Strategic Partnerships

**Cleaning Supply Brands**
- Approach P&G Professional, SC Johnson, or Method for exclusive deals
- Value prop to brands: direct access to thousands of short-term rentals, data on product usage, potential for product placement/testing
- Revenue share or white-label products ("Powered by [Brand]")
- Opportunity to test new products with real-world feedback loop

**Amazon Business Integration**
- Become an Amazon Business affiliate or authorized reseller
- Negotiate bulk pricing tiers as we aggregate demand
- Explore Amazon's "Business Prime" for better shipping rates across our network
- Long-term: could we become a preferred vendor within Amazon's ecosystem?

**Wholesale Club Partnerships**
- Costco Business Center, Sam's Club, or Restaurant Depot
- Regional fulfillment partnerships where Amazon doesn't make sense
- Some items (bulk toilet paper, cleaning supplies) are cheaper through these channels

**Property Management Software Integration**
- Guesty, Hostaway, Lodgify, Hospitable - all have marketplaces
- Become a preferred vendor or native integration
- Revenue share model or API licensing fees

---

### 3. The Data Play - Our Underrated Asset

**Aggregate Purchasing Intelligence**
- We'll know exactly what 10,000+ properties consume monthly
- Which products get the best reviews? Which run out fastest?
- Seasonality patterns (sunscreen in summer, hand sanitizer in flu season)
- This data has value beyond our platform

**Bulk Negotiation Power**
- "We represent 500,000 toilet paper rolls per year across our network"
- Manufacturer-direct relationships become possible at scale
- Could reduce COGS 15-30% with volume commitments

**Benchmarking Reports**
- Sell anonymized benchmarking data back to hosts
- "Your property uses 2x the paper towels of similar properties - here's why"
- Consulting revenue stream, also drives efficiency (lower costs for hosts = stickier customers)

**Industry Reports & PR**
- Publish annual "State of Short-Term Rental Supplies" report
- Media attention, thought leadership, attracts enterprise customers
- Free marketing that positions us as the expert

---

### 4. White-Label Opportunities

**Property Management Software White-Label**
- Offer our restocking engine as a white-label service to Guesty, Hostaway, etc.
- They brand it as their own feature, we handle fulfillment
- Revenue share per order or monthly licensing fee
- Lower CAC - they bring their existing customer base

**Franchise/Regional Operator Model**
- License our tech and playbook to regional operators
- They handle local relationships, we provide software and supplier connections
- Works well for international expansion (local operators understand regulations, preferences)

**Cleaning Company White-Label**
- Offer to cleaning companies serving vacation rentals
- "Add restocking to your service offering without building infrastructure"
- They upsell to their clients, we fulfill, everyone wins

**Real Estate Brokerages**
- Partner with brokerages that specialize in investment properties
- "Buy a rental property, get restocking included for year one"
- Lead gen for us, value-add for them

---

### 5. Adjacent Services - Expanding the Ecosystem

**Cleaning Coordination**
- We already know when properties need restocking (after each turnover)
- Natural extension: coordinate cleaning too
- Don't employ cleaners - be the scheduling/dispatch layer
- Integrate with cleaning marketplaces (TurnoverBnB, Properly)

**Maintenance Scheduling**
- Same logic: track maintenance items, schedule preventive maintenance
- HVAC filter changes, pest control, seasonal prep
- Partner with local handyman networks or TaskRabbit Pro

**Guest Experience Add-ons**
- Pre-arrival grocery stocking (premium service)
- Welcome baskets with local products
- "Make it feel like home before they arrive"

**Smart Home Integration**
- Connect with smart locks, thermostats, sensors
- Detect low inventory through smart scales/sensors
- Automatic reorder triggers
- IoT play is capital-intensive but defensible

**Deep Cleaning Scheduling**
- Track cumulative guest nights, trigger deep cleans
- Coordinate with regular turnover cleaners or specialist teams
- "Your property has had 50 turnovers - time for a deep clean"

---

### 6. Geographic Expansion Considerations

**U.S. Market Prioritization**
- Start in high-density vacation rental markets: Florida (Orlando, Miami, Keys), California (Palm Springs, San Diego), Arizona (Phoenix, Scottsdale), Texas (Austin, Gulf Coast)
- Coastal markets have high turnover = high consumable usage
- Ski towns (Tahoe, Park City, Colorado) have seasonal spikes

**International Complexity**
- Product preferences vary dramatically (bidet supplies in Japan, different toiletries in Europe)
- Fulfillment partnerships needed in each market (not just Amazon)
- Regulatory differences (product safety standards, labeling)
- Consider licensing model over direct operation

**Hub-and-Spoke Fulfillment**
- If we ever hold inventory, regional warehouses in key markets
- 1-day delivery in core markets, 2-day elsewhere
- Start with 3PL partnerships before building own infrastructure

**Local Supplier Integration**
- Not everything should ship from Amazon
- Local specialty items (local coffee for welcome gifts)
- Support local businesses = marketing angle + potentially better margins

---

### 7. B2B Opportunities - Beyond Vacation Rentals

**Boutique Hotels & Independent Properties**
- Small hotels (under 50 rooms) often lack purchasing sophistication
- Same problems as vacation rentals: consumable management is a hassle
- Higher volume per customer, potentially stickier

**Corporate Housing & Furnished Apartments**
- Companies like Blueground, Zeus Living, Sonder
- Longer stays = different consumption patterns, but similar needs
- Could white-label to these operators

**Senior Living & Assisted Living**
- Apartments within senior communities need consumable management
- Facility managers are overwhelmed - outsourcing is attractive
- Larger facilities = higher volume accounts
- Regulatory considerations around certain products

**University Housing**
- Student apartments, Greek housing
- Seasonal patterns align with academic calendar
- Could partner with university housing offices

**Co-Living Spaces**
- Common areas need constant restocking
- Emerging market with well-funded operators (Common, Bungalow)

**Medical/Dental Offices**
- Not core focus, but consumable management is universal problem
- Waiting rooms need magazines, tissues, sanitizer
- Regulatory requirements make this more complex

---

### The 10-Year Vision

**Phase 1 (Now - Year 2):** Nail the core - restocking consumables for vacation rentals via Amazon dropship. Prove the model, build the tech.

**Phase 2 (Years 2-4):** Expand product categories (linens, small appliances). Build supplier relationships. Integrate with top 5 property management platforms.

**Phase 3 (Years 4-6):** Launch adjacent services (cleaning coordination, maintenance). Aggregate data becomes valuable. Enter corporate housing and boutique hotel markets.

**Phase 4 (Years 6-10):** Full property lifecycle management. International expansion via licensing. Become the operating system for property operations.

**The Dream Exit:** Acquired by Airbnb, Vrbo, or a major property management software company who wants to own the operations layer. Or: IPO as the "Veeva for property management" - vertical SaaS with deep operational capabilities.

---

### Key Risks & Considerations

- **Amazon dependency:** If Amazon changes terms, raises fees, or enters this space directly, we're exposed. Diversify suppliers early.
- **Capital intensity:** Moving beyond dropship to holding inventory or offering appliances requires capital. Stay lean as long as possible.
- **Marketplace dynamics:** Cleaning and maintenance are competitive, low-margin markets. Only enter if we can differentiate with data/tech.
- **B2B sales cycles:** Enterprise customers (hotels, corporate housing) have long sales cycles and complex procurement. Budget for this.

---

*Next steps: Discuss with Seb, prioritize 2-3 ideas to explore deeper, validate with customer interviews.*

---

## Business Model & Pricing Strategy

### Executive Summary

The restocking service transforms our inventory SaaS from a passive tracking tool into an active operations partner. The key insight: **we never hold inventory**. We act as an intelligent purchasing agent, leveraging Amazon's fulfillment network while capturing margin through service fees and smart procurement.

---

### 1. Pricing Models Evaluated

#### Option A: Pure Markup Model (10-20% on items)
**How it works:** We add a margin to every item purchased through our system.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Revenue scales with usage | Transparent - customers can price-check |
| Simple to understand | Race to bottom on commodity items |
| Aligns incentives (we want quality items) | Amazon price fluctuations eat margin |

**Verdict:** Too exposed. A single price-conscious customer Googling "Costco toilet paper 30 pack" kills trust.

#### Option B: Flat Monthly Fee
**How it works:** $X/month for unlimited restocking orders.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Predictable revenue | Unpredictable costs per customer |
| Simple for customers | Heavy users subsidized by light users |
| Encourages adoption | No incentive to optimize orders |

**Verdict:** Works for subscription psychology but needs guardrails.

#### Option C: Per-Order Fee
**How it works:** Flat fee per restocking order placed.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Fair - pay for what you use | Discourages optimal ordering frequency |
| Predictable unit economics | Customers batch orders (worse for properties) |
| Easy to explain | Low-touch customers feel nickeled |

**Verdict:** Creates wrong incentives. We want frequent, proactive restocking.

#### Option D: Hybrid Model (RECOMMENDED)

**Structure:**
```
Base Subscription + Included Orders + Smart Savings Share
```

**The Model:**
1. **Platform Fee:** Included in subscription tier (see tier structure below)
2. **Included Orders:** X orders/month included, then $4.99/order overage
3. **Procurement Savings Share:** We find deals, split savings 70/30 (customer/us)
4. **Priority Shipping Upgrade:** Optional $2.99 for 1-day vs standard 2-day

**Why This Works:**
- Base fee covers our operational costs
- Included orders encourage adoption without abuse
- Savings share aligns incentives (we're rewarded for finding deals)
- Shipping upgrade is pure margin with clear value

---

### 2. Profit Margin Strategy (Without Holding Inventory)

#### Revenue Streams

| Stream | Margin | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Subscription fees** | 80-90% | Pure software margin |
| **Procurement service fee** | 100% | $3-5 per order, covers ops |
| **Affiliate/referral commissions** | 1-8% | Amazon Associates, bulk suppliers |
| **Bulk purchasing spreads** | 5-15% | Buy bulk, ship units, keep difference |
| **Preferred vendor partnerships** | 10-20% | Cleaning supply companies, linens |
| **Shipping optimization** | Variable | Combine orders, save on shipping |
| **Priority service upsells** | 100% | Same-day coordination, white-glove |

#### The Amazon Affiliate Angle
Amazon Associates pays 1-4% on most categories. At scale:
- 1,000 properties x $150/month average restocking = $150,000/month GMV
- 3% average commission = **$4,500/month passive income**
- This alone can offset customer acquisition costs

#### Bulk Purchase Arbitrage
For high-frequency items (toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies):
1. Negotiate with suppliers (Uline, Costco Business, Restaurant Depot)
2. Ship direct from supplier to property
3. Price to customer at "Amazon price" (often lower)
4. Capture spread of 10-20%

**Example:**
- Commercial toilet paper case: $45 from Uline (free shipping over $350)
- Same quality on Amazon: $58
- We charge: $52 (customer saves $6, we make $7)

#### No Inventory Risk Model
```
Customer clicks "Restock" -> We place Amazon order -> Amazon ships direct
                          |
              We never touch product
              We never hold inventory
              We never manage returns (Amazon handles)
```

### 5. Value Proposition Framework

#### Primary Value: Time Savings

**The Math:**
| Task | Time (Manual) | Time (With Us) |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Check inventory | 15 min/property/week | 0 (automated) |
| Create shopping list | 10 min/order | 0 (auto-generated) |
| Place order | 8 min/order | 1 click |
| Coordinate delivery | 15 min/order | 0 (we handle) |
| Track shipments | 5 min/order | 0 (we notify) |

**Per Property Monthly:**
- Manual: ~3 hours/month
- With us: ~10 minutes/month

**At 10 Properties:**
- Manual: 30 hours/month
- With us: 1.5 hours/month
- **Time saved: 28.5 hours/month**
- At $50/hour opportunity cost: **$1,425/month value**

We charge $199. That is a **7x ROI on time alone**.

#### Secondary Value: Never Run Out

**The Guest Experience Disaster Scenario:**
1. Guest arrives at 11 PM after flight delay
2. No toilet paper in bathroom
3. 1-star review: "Basic amenities missing"
4. Listing ranking drops
5. 3-5 lost bookings over next month
6. **Cost: $500-2,000 in lost revenue**

**Our Prevention:**
- Predictive restocking based on booking calendar
- Pre-arrival checks triggered by PMS integration
- Buffer stock alerts (reorder at 20% not 5%)

**Messaging:** "One 1-star review costs more than a year of our service."

#### Tertiary Value: Cost Optimization

- Bulk pricing access small hosts cannot get
- Price tracking - we buy when prices dip
- Substitute recommendations for out-of-stock items
- Annual spend analytics - see exactly where money goes

---

### 6. Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### Risk: Amazon Price Spikes

**Scenario:** Toilet paper goes from $25 to $45 during supply crunch

**Mitigations:**
1. **Price ceiling alerts:** We pause auto-orders above 130% of baseline
2. **Alternative sourcing:** Automatic fallback to Walmart, Target, Costco APIs
3. **Bulk buffer:** Negotiate with suppliers for fixed-price contracts on staples
4. **Customer notification:** "Price spike detected. Approve order or wait?"
5. **Price lock guarantee:** For Enterprise tier, we absorb up to 15% spikes

**Contract language:** "We guarantee competitive pricing. If total order exceeds 120% of our baseline, we will alert you before processing."

#### Risk: Out of Stock Items

**Scenario:** Preferred brand unavailable

**Mitigations:**
1. **Substitution engine:** Pre-approved alternatives ranked by similarity
2. **Multi-supplier network:** Amazon, Walmart, Target, Costco, Uline
3. **Property-specific rules:** "Never substitute eco-friendly products" flags
4. **Proactive alerts:** "Bounty paper towels unavailable for 2+ weeks. Want to switch to Brawny?"

**Feature: Substitution Preferences**
```
[ ] Allow any substitution
[x] Allow same-brand, different size
[x] Allow same-category, similar price
[ ] Allow same-category, any price
[x] Always notify me of substitutions
```

#### Risk: Delivery Failures

**Scenario:** Package stolen, delivered to wrong property

**Mitigations:**
1. **Smart lock integration:** Delivery inside property, not porch
2. **Photo confirmation:** Require delivery photo
3. **Backup order:** Auto-reorder if not delivered within window
4. **Insurance:** Include $500 delivery insurance in Enterprise tier

#### Risk: Customer Disputes Over Pricing

**Scenario:** Customer claims we are overcharging vs. Amazon direct

**Mitigations:**
1. **Radical transparency:** Show Amazon price + our service fee separately
2. **Receipt forwarding:** Send original Amazon receipt with every order
3. **Price match guarantee:** "Find it cheaper on Amazon, we will match + 5% credit"
4. **Value framing:** Always show time saved, not just item cost

#### Risk: Supplier Dependency (Amazon)

**Scenario:** Amazon changes affiliate terms, suspends account

**Mitigations:**
1. **Multi-supplier architecture:** Build with Walmart, Target, Costco from day one
2. **Direct vendor relationships:** Develop 3-5 direct supplier contracts
3. **Graceful degradation:** Fall back to shopping list export (Starter tier behavior)
4. **Revenue diversification:** Never more than 40% of margin from any one source

---

### 7. Launch Strategy

#### Phase 1: Beta (Month 1-2)
- 20 hand-picked customers (existing power users)
- Professional tier only
- Amazon-only fulfillment
- Goal: Validate unit economics, identify edge cases

#### Phase 2: Limited Launch (Month 3-4)
- Open to all existing customers
- All tiers available
- Add Walmart as backup supplier
- Goal: 100 customers on restocking service

#### Phase 3: General Availability (Month 5+)
- Public marketing
- Enterprise features complete
- 3+ supplier integrations
- Goal: 30% of customers on paid restocking tier

---

### 8. Financial Projections (Year 1)

**Assumptions:**
- 500 total customers by end of year
- 30% on Professional ($79) = 150 customers
- 10% on Enterprise ($199) = 50 customers
- 60% on Starter ($29) = 300 customers
- 20% of Starter add Restock+ ($25) = 60 customers

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (Month 12):**
| Tier | Customers | MRR |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Starter | 300 | $8,700 |
| Starter + Restock+ | 60 | $3,240 |
| Professional | 150 | $11,850 |
| Enterprise | 50 | $9,950 |
| **Total MRR** | **500** | **$33,740** |

**Restocking Revenue (Month 12):**
- ~200 customers with restocking
- Average 4 orders/month = 800 orders
- $4 average margin per order = **$3,200/month**

**Affiliate/Supplier Revenue (Month 12):**
- $150 average order value x 800 orders = $120,000 GMV
- 4% average take rate = **$4,800/month**

**Total Monthly Revenue (Month 12): ~$41,740**
**Annual Run Rate: ~$500,000**

---

### 9. Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Restocking Adoption Rate | 40%+ | Core feature validation |
| Orders per Customer/Month | 4+ | Engagement & margin |
| Average Order Value | $100+ | Revenue per transaction |
| Substitution Acceptance Rate | 80%+ | Automation success |
| Time from Alert to Delivery | <48 hrs | Value proposition |
| Customer Support Tickets/Order | <0.1 | Operational efficiency |
| Net Revenue Retention | 110%+ | Expansion revenue working |

---

### 10. Open Questions for Seb

1. **Geographic focus:** Start US-only or include UK/EU? (Supplier complexity)
2. **Cleaning supplies vs. amenities:** Do we do linens, welcome baskets? Higher margin, more complexity.
3. **White-label opportunity:** Let property managers resell to their owners?
4. **Integration priority:** Which PMS integrations first? (Hostaway, Guesty, Lodgify)
5. **Pricing psychology:** $79 vs $99 for Professional - what signals quality?

## User Experience Design

*Detailed UX specifications for the hands-off restocking service - designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing Rental Helper interface.*

### Overview

The restocking service should feel like a natural extension of the existing inventory management flow. Users already track what items are running low; this feature simply adds the capability to automatically replenish those items. The UX should emphasize trust, transparency, and control.

**Design Principles:**
1. **Progressive disclosure** - Start simple, reveal complexity only when needed
2. **Trust through transparency** - Show every cost, every step
3. **Sensible defaults** - Work out of the box, customize for power users
4. **Graceful degradation** - Always provide manual fallbacks

---

### 1. Onboarding Flow

#### First-Time Setup Wizard

When a user on a qualifying plan (Pro or Max tier) first accesses the restocking feature, they see a guided setup wizard. This follows the existing Rental Helper card-based UI pattern.

**Step 1: Welcome & Concept**
```
+--------------------------------------------+

```

#### Low Stock Alert Enhancement

Modify existing low stock card to include restocking context:
```
+--------------------------------------------+
| Low Stock Alert                             |
| (existing rose-50 styling)                  |
+--------------------------------------------+
|                                            |
| Toilet Paper                               |
| Current: 2 | Par: 12                       |
| Restocking: Order pending approval         |
| [Review Order]                             |
|                                            |

| Dish Soap                                  |
| Current: 0 | Par: 3                        |
| Restocking: Arriving tomorrow              |
| [Track Delivery]                           |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

#### Cleaning Reports Integration

Enhance the cleaning report form at `/staff/report/[propertyId]`:

```
+--------------------------------------------+
| Item Counts                                 |
+--------------------------------------------+
|                                            |
| Toilet Paper:   [ 2 ]  (Low - badge:rose)  |
| Paper Towels:   [ 8 ]                      |
| Dish Soap:      [ 0 ]  (Out - badge:rose)  |
|                                            |
| [x] Request restocking for low items       |

| [Submit Report]                            |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

Manager notification:
```
+--------------------------------------------+

## Logistics & Technical Implementation

*Deep dive into the practical aspects of building automated restocking - APIs, architecture, legal considerations, and supplier options.*

### 1. Amazon APIs and Programs

#### Amazon Selling Partner API (SP-API)
The SP-API is Amazon's modern API for sellers and developers. However, it is designed primarily for **sellers on Amazon's marketplace**, not for programmatic purchasing. Key points:

- **Purpose**: SP-API enables sellers to manage listings, orders, fulfillment, and reports for products they sell ON Amazon
- **Not suitable for buying**: There is no official Amazon API for programmatic purchasing as a buyer
- **Authentication**: Uses LWA (Login with Amazon) OAuth 2.0 flow with role-based permissions
- **Relevance to us**: Limited - we are buyers, not sellers

#### Amazon Business
Amazon Business is the B2B arm of Amazon, offering:

- **Business Prime**: Free shipping, quantity discounts, tax-exempt purchasing
- **Punchout Catalogs**: Integration with procurement systems via cXML/OCI protocols
- **Amazon Business API**: Limited API access for approved enterprise partners
- **Approval requirements**: Must be an established business with significant purchasing volume
- **Guided Buying**: Set purchasing policies and preferred products

**Integration path for our use case**:
1. Register as an Amazon Business customer
2. Apply for Amazon Business API access (requires business justification and significant volume)
3. Use Punchout integration if approved, or explore compliant alternatives

#### Amazon Product Advertising API (PA-API)
This is Amazon's affiliate program API:

- **Purpose**: Retrieve product information, prices, and generate affiliate links
- **Can do**: Search products, get pricing, get availability, retrieve ASINs
- **Cannot do**: Place orders, manage cart, process payments
- **Rate limits**: 1 request/second base, scales with revenue generated through affiliate links
- **Useful for**: Product catalog building, price monitoring, ASIN lookup, generating one-click purchase links

#### The Hard Truth About Amazon Ordering APIs
Amazon does not provide a public API for placing orders as a buyer. Available options:

1. **Amazon Business Punchout** (requires partnership approval and significant volume)
2. **Browser automation** (violates TOS - see legal section below)
3. **Third-party procurement platforms** (Coupa, SAP Ariba, Procurify - enterprise-focused)
4. **Manual ordering with smart notifications** (compliant fallback - recommended for MVP)

---

### 2. Automating Orders When Inventory Hits Low Thresholds

#### Threshold Detection System

Based on the existing `WarehouseItem` model in our codebase, we already have:
- `quantity`: Current stock level
- `parLevel`: Target inventory level
- `lowStockThreshold`: Alert trigger point
- `burnRateHistory`: Usage pattern data

**Proposed Restock Trigger Logic**:

```typescript
interface RestockTrigger {
  itemId: string;
  sku: string;
  currentQuantity: number;
  lowStockThreshold: number;
  parLevel: number;
  suggestedOrderQuantity: number;  // parLevel - currentQuantity
  estimatedDaysUntilStockout: number;
  priority: 'critical' | 'low' | 'normal';
}

// Trigger conditions:
// - Immediate: quantity <= lowStockThreshold
// - Predictive: estimated stockout < leadTime + safetyBuffer
// Order quantity calculation: parLevel - currentQuantity
// Priority assignment: based on burnRate vs remaining stock
```

#### Predictive Reordering

Using the existing `burnRateHistory` field, implement predictive ordering:

```typescript
function calculateReorderPoint(item: IWarehouseItem): Date {
  const avgDailyBurn = calculateAverageBurnRate(item.burnRateHistory);
  const daysOfStock = item.quantity / avgDailyBurn;
  const leadTimeDays = 3; // Amazon typical delivery
  const safetyStockDays = 2;

  const reorderInDays = daysOfStock - leadTimeDays - safetyStockDays;
  return addDays(new Date(), Math.max(0, reorderInDays));
}

function calculateAverageBurnRate(history: IBurnRateEntry[]): number {
  const last30Days = history.filter(
    entry => entry.date > subDays(new Date(), 30)
  );
  if (last30Days.length === 0) return 0;
  const totalUsed = last30Days.reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.amountUsed, 0);
  return totalUsed / 30;
}
```

#### Restock Queue Architecture

```
+-----------------+     +------------------+     +-----------------+
|   Inventory     |---->|  Restock Queue   |---->|  Order Manager  |
|   Monitor       |     |  (Priority-based)|     |                 |
|  (Cron/Webhook) |     |                  |     |                 |
+-----------------+     +------------------+     +-----------------+
                                                          |
                        +--------------------+------------+------------+
                        |                    |                         |
                        v                    v                         v
               +----------------+   +-----------------+   +------------------+
               | Manual Order   |   | Amazon Business |   |  Alternative     |
               | Notification   |   | (if approved)   |   |  Suppliers       |
               | (Email/SMS)    |   |                 |   |  (Grainger API)  |
               +----------------+   +-----------------+   +------------------+
```

#### Implementation Components

1. **Inventory Monitor Service** (Cron job or real-time via webhooks)
   - Check all items where `quantity <= lowStockThreshold`
   - Calculate priority based on burn rate and days until stockout
   - Create restock requests in queue

2. **Restock Request Model** (New MongoDB model):
```typescript
interface IRestockRequest {
  ownerId: string;
  warehouseItemId: string;
  propertyId?: string;  // For direct-to-property shipping
  quantity: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'ordered' | 'shipped' | 'delivered' | 'cancelled';
  supplierPreference: 'amazon' | 'walmart' | 'wholesale' | 'any';
  shippingAddress: IAddress;
  estimatedCost: number;
  actualCost?: number;
  externalOrderId?: string;  // Tracking from supplier
  amazonAsin?: string;
  productUrl?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  approvedAt?: Date;
  orderedAt?: Date;
  shippedAt?: Date;
  deliveredAt?: Date;
}
```

3. **Approval Workflow** (Configurable based on tier)
   - Auto-approve for amounts under configurable threshold (e.g., $50)
   - Require manual approval for large orders
   - Daily/weekly digest of pending restocks for review
   - Emergency override for critical items

---

### 3. Delivery Logistics to Multiple Properties

#### Multi-Address Shipping Challenge

Each property needs its own delivery address. The existing `Property` model has an `address` field that can be extended.

**Enhanced Property Model for Shipping**:
```typescript
interface IShippingAddress {
  street1: string;
  street2?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postalCode: string;
  country: string;
  deliveryInstructions?: string;  // "Leave at lockbox", "Use code 1234"
  accessNotes?: string;           // Gate codes, building access info
  preferredCarrier?: string;      // 'ups' | 'fedex' | 'usps' | 'amazon'
  requiresSignature: boolean;
  amazonDeliveryPreference?: 'door' | 'garage' | 'locker';
}

interface IPropertyExtended extends IProperty {
  shippingAddress: IShippingAddress;
  isShippingEnabled: boolean;
  shippingTier: 'standard' | 'priority' | 'overnight';
}
```

#### Shipping Strategy Options

**Option 1: Direct-to-Property Shipping**
- Each property has its own verified delivery address
- Amazon/suppliers ship directly to property
- **Best for**: Remote properties, hands-off management, properties with lockboxes
- **Challenge**: Package theft, no one to receive, weather exposure
- **Mitigation**: Require lockbox photo, use Amazon Key, smart doorbell integration

**Option 2: Central Warehouse Model**
- Ship all items to central location (owner's home/office or regional hub)
- Owner/manager distributes to properties
- **Best for**: Clustered properties, quality control, high-value items
- **Challenge**: Extra handling time, delayed delivery, additional labor

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- Low-value/bulk items: Direct to property (toilet paper, trash bags)
- High-value items: Central location (electronics, expensive toiletries)
- Configurable per item type or per property preference

#### Amazon Delivery Solutions

1. **Amazon Key for Business**
   - Allows in-garage/in-home delivery with compatible smart lock
   - Ideal for vacation rentals already using smart home tech
   - Integration: Amazon Sidewalk Bridge, Ring, August, Yale locks
   - Setup: Property owner links Amazon account to smart lock

2. **Amazon Locker/Hub**
   - Package pickup points in apartment buildings, Whole Foods, etc.
   - Good for urban properties without secure delivery location
   - Requires guest or cleaner to retrieve packages
   - Free to use with Amazon orders

3. **Amazon Day Delivery**
   - Consolidate all deliveries to specific day(s) of week
   - Reduces package management complexity
   - Align with cleaning schedule for easy restocking
   - Available with Prime membership

#### Third-Party Logistics Integration

Consider integrating with shipping APIs for tracking and notifications:

- **Shippo or EasyPost**: Multi-carrier shipping APIs, label generation, tracking
- **Route**: Package tracking and insurance, branded tracking pages
- **AfterShip**: Tracking aggregation across all carriers
- **ParcelLab**: Delivery experience platform for notifications

### 4. Legal/TOS Considerations for Programmatic Amazon Ordering

#### Amazon's Terms of Service - Critical Points

From Amazon's Conditions of Use, the following are **prohibited**:

1. **Automated Access**: "You may not use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access the Amazon Services for any purpose without our express written permission"

2. **Commercial Use**: Using Amazon for systematic purchasing for resale without appropriate seller agreements

3. **Multiple Accounts**: Creating multiple buyer accounts to circumvent limits or abuse promotions

4. **API Misuse**: Using APIs (like PA-API) outside their intended scope and documentation

#### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Approach | TOS Compliance | Risk Level | Account Ban Risk | Notes |
|----------|---------------|------------|------------------|-------|
| Manual ordering via dashboard | Fully Compliant | None | None | Full TOS compliance |
| Email notifications with links | Fully Compliant | None | None | User places orders manually |
| Amazon Business API (approved) | Fully Compliant | None | None | Requires partnership approval |
| Browser automation (Selenium/Puppeteer) | Violates TOS | High | Very High | Account termination likely |
| Third-party procurement tools | Varies | Medium | Medium | Depends on tool's agreement with Amazon |
| PA-API for product lookup only | Fully Compliant | None | None | Read-only product information |
| Amazon Subscribe & Save | Fully Compliant | None | None | User sets up, we monitor |

#### Recommended Compliant Approaches

**Approach 1: "Smart Notification" Model (Safest - Recommended for MVP)**
- System detects low inventory via threshold monitoring
- Generates shopping list with direct Amazon links (using PA-API for current pricing)
- Emails property owner with one-click links to Amazon cart
- Owner manually completes purchase (fully compliant)
- Owner confirms order in our system for tracking
- We track delivery and close the loop

**Approach 2: Amazon Business Partnership (Best if approved)**
- Apply for Amazon Business API access
- Requires significant business justification and volume commitment
- Full programmatic ordering capability if approved
- Typical approval timeline: 3-6 months
- Requires dedicated business account manager relationship

**Approach 3: Amazon Subscribe & Save Integration (Hybrid)**
- Property owner sets up Subscribe & Save for recurring items
- Our system monitors and suggests adjustments via Amazon's interface
- User manages subscriptions through Amazon, we track consumption
- Compliant because user controls all Amazon interactions

**Approach 4: Dash Replenishment Service (DRS) - IoT Path**
- For properties with smart devices (smart dispensers, scales)
- Device triggers reorder when product runs low
- Requires DRS device certification (complex but fully automated)
- Future consideration when smart home integration is priority

#### Structuring the Business to Minimize Legal Risk

1. **Agency Relationship Documentation**
   - Property owner explicitly authorizes orders on their behalf in our TOS
   - Orders placed under owner's Amazon account, not ours
   - Clear terms that we facilitate, owner purchases
   - No pooling of orders across multiple owners on single account

2. **No Product Markup**
   - Charge for service (subscription, per-order fee), not product markup
   - Pass through actual product costs transparently
   - Avoids reseller classification and associated regulations

3. **Audit Trail Requirements**
   - Log all restock decisions, recommendations, and approvals
   - Maintain receipts and order confirmations
   - Clear ownership chain of goods (owner purchases, we facilitate)
   - Retention policy for financial/tax purposes

4. **Terms of Service Clarity**
   - Users acknowledge they are the purchaser, we are a facilitation service
   - Users responsible for their Amazon account standing
   - Indemnification clause for any Amazon TOS issues

---

### 5. Alternative Suppliers (Beyond Amazon)

#### Walmart Business - Strong Alternative

**Walmart Business Account**
- B2B purchasing program for businesses
- Net 30 payment terms available
- Quantity discounts on bulk purchases
- **API status**: No public ordering API, similar limitations to Amazon

**Walmart+ Benefits**
- Free shipping on orders $35+
- Fuel discounts (useful for property managers traveling between properties)
- Scan & Go for in-store purchases

**Integration approach**: Same "smart notification" model as Amazon - generate Walmart links, user places order.

#### Wholesale Distributors (Best for True Automation)

These suppliers actually have B2B ordering APIs designed for programmatic purchasing:

**Cleaning Supplies**
| Supplier | Has API | Min Order | Shipping | Best For |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Grainger | Yes (full API) | None | Free $50+ | Maintenance, cleaning supplies |
| Zoro (Grainger subsidiary) | Yes | None | Free $50+ | Industrial supplies, better prices |
| Uline | No (fax/phone) | None | Ships same day | Bulk packaging, trash bags, paper |
| CleanItSupply | Limited | $100 | Free $100+ | Professional cleaning chemicals |

**Paper Goods & Toiletries**
| Supplier | Has API | Min Order | Best For |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| Staples Business Advantage | Yes | None | Paper products, office supplies |
| Office Depot Business | Yes | None | Paper products, cleaning |
| Georgia-Pacific Direct | Yes (EDI) | High volume | Bulk toilet paper, paper towels |

**Hospitality-Specific Suppliers**
| Supplier | Has API | Min Order | Best For |
|----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| HD Supply (Hospitality) | Limited | Varies | Hotel supplies, bulk amenities |
| Guest Supply (Sysco) | No | $200 | Hotel toiletries, amenities |
| American Hotel Register | Limited | $100 | Full hospitality catalog |
| Gilchrist & Soames | No | $250 | Premium bath amenities |

#### API-Enabled Suppliers - Detailed

**Grainger (grainger.com)**
- Full REST API for product search, pricing, ordering, and tracking
- Developer portal with documentation
- OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Inventory levels available in real-time
- **Best for**: Maintenance supplies, cleaning equipment, safety supplies
- **Integration effort**: Medium - well-documented API

**Zoro (zoro.com)**
- Same parent company as Grainger, similar API
- Lower prices, targeted at smaller businesses
- Good for price-sensitive customers

**Staples Business Advantage**
- EDI integration (X12 standard) or REST API
- Punchout catalog support (cXML)
- Account manager for business setup
- **Best for**: Paper products, office supplies, cleaning supplies

#### Supplier Abstraction Layer (Technical Design)

Build a supplier-agnostic ordering system:

```typescript
// Supplier interface - all suppliers implement this
interface ISupplierAdapter {
  name: string;
  type: 'api' | 'manual' | 'punchout';

  // Product operations
  searchProducts(query: string): Promise<ISupplierProduct[]>;
  getProduct(sku: string): Promise<ISupplierProduct | null>;
  checkAvailability(sku: string, quantity: number): Promise<IAvailability>;

  // Order operations (for API-enabled suppliers)
  createOrder?(items: IOrderItem[], shippingAddress: IAddress): Promise<IOrder>;
  getOrderStatus?(orderId: string): Promise<IOrderStatus>;
  cancelOrder?(orderId: string): Promise<boolean>;
}

interface ISupplierProduct {
  supplierId: string;
  supplierName: string;
  externalSku: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  unitOfMeasure: string;
  packSize: number;
  availability: 'in_stock' | 'limited' | 'out_of_stock' | 'discontinued';
  estimatedDeliveryDays: number;
  imageUrl?: string;
  productUrl: string;  // For manual ordering fallback
}

interface IProductMapping {
  warehouseItemId: string;  // Our internal item
  mappings: {
    supplierId: string;
    externalSku: string;
    priority: number;  // 1 = primary, 2 = first backup, etc.
    notes?: string;    // "Only for bulk orders over 100 units"
  }[];
}

// Example supplier adapters
class GraingerAdapter implements ISupplierAdapter { /* ... */ }
class AmazonPAAPIAdapter implements ISupplierAdapter { /* read-only, manual ordering */ }
class StaplesAdapter implements ISupplierAdapter { /* ... */ }
```

#### Supplier Selection Logic

```typescript
async function selectBestSupplier(
  item: IWarehouseItem,
  quantity: number,
  constraints: IOrderConstraints
): Promise<ISupplierProduct | null> {
  const mappings = await getProductMappings(item._id);

  // Sort by priority
  const sortedMappings = mappings.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);

  for (const mapping of sortedMappings) {
    const supplier = getSupplierAdapter(mapping.supplierId);
    const product = await supplier.getProduct(mapping.externalSku);

    if (!product) continue;

    // Check constraints
    if (product.availability === 'out_of_stock') continue;
    if (product.price > constraints.maxPricePerUnit) continue;
    if (product.estimatedDeliveryDays > constraints.maxDeliveryDays) continue;

    return product;
  }

  return null; // No suitable supplier found
}
```

**Deliverables:**
- Inventory threshold monitoring (cron job every 15 minutes)
- Email notifications with Amazon product links (using PA-API)
- Basic restock request tracking (pending, ordered, delivered)
- Manual order confirmation workflow

**Technical tasks:**

### 7. Cost Analysis for Property Owners

#### Per-Order Economics

```
Product Cost:              $X (pass-through, no markup)
Shipping:                  $0-5 (Prime/free shipping thresholds)
Platform Fee Options:
  - Per order:             $2-5 per order
  - Included in tier:      $0 (offset by subscription)
Time Saved:                ~15-30 min per manual order
Value to Owner:            Fewer stockouts, happier guests, less mental load
```

#### Subscription Tier Integration

| Tier | Restock Feature | Pricing Model |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| Basic ($X/mo) | Manual alerts only (email when low) | Included |
| Pro ($X/mo) | Smart notifications with one-click Amazon links | Included |
| Premium ($X/mo) | Semi-automated ordering (approval workflow) | Included |
| Enterprise (Custom) | Full automation via wholesale APIs | Per-order fee or included |

#### ROI for Property Owner

For a property doing 100 turnovers/year:
- Without service: ~2 hours/month on supply ordering = 24 hours/year
- With service: ~15 min/month oversight = 3 hours/year
- **Time saved: 21 hours/year**
- At $50/hour effective owner time: **$1,050/year value**

Additional value:
- Fewer emergency stockouts (guest satisfaction)
- Never forget to restock (consistency)
- Price optimization (bulk when cheap)
- Audit trail for business expenses

### 9. Key Takeaways for Seb Discussion

1. **Amazon programmatic ordering is not straightforward** - There is no public buying API. Amazon Business partnership is the only compliant path for true automation, and it requires significant volume and a 3-6 month approval process.

2. **"Smart notifications" is the pragmatic MVP** - Detect low stock, generate shopping lists with Amazon links via PA-API, let owners click to order. Fully TOS-compliant, zero legal risk, and delivers immediate value.

3. **Wholesale distributors are better for automation** - Grainger, Staples Business, and Zoro have actual ordering APIs designed for B2B programmatic purchasing. We should integrate these for customers who want hands-off automation.

4. **Hybrid supplier strategy is optimal** - Amazon for convenience and variety (via manual links), wholesale distributors for bulk staples (via API), and manual fallback for edge cases.

5. **Multi-property shipping is solvable** - Direct-to-property works with lockboxes, smart locks, or Amazon Key. Consider Amazon Day to consolidate deliveries with cleaning schedule.

6. **Revenue model options**:
   - Include basic notifications in all tiers (drives engagement)
   - Per-order fee ($2-5) for automated wholesale ordering
   - Include full automation in Premium/Enterprise tiers to drive upgrades
   - Never markup products - charge for service, not goods

7. **Legal posture is clean** - By using the smart notification model and wholesale supplier APIs, we avoid any gray areas. Users are the purchasers; we are a facilitation layer.

8. **The data moat grows** - Every restock order adds to our understanding of property consumption patterns. This data enables better predictions, bulk negotiation, and eventually premium analytics features.
